The query syntax draws inspiration from GraphQL and is similar, but with many differences. Some capabilities missing from GraphQL have been added, and some capabilities found in GraphQL have a different syntax. We believe that much of conventional SQL syntax is still preferable to creating a completely new syntax for every single feature of the query language (i.e., conventional syntax wherever possible). However, whereas SQL can be seen as a “low level” relational query language, OQL takes a higher level Entity-Relationship (ER) Model view of the database.\nThe name “OQL” refers to both a software library, and a query language implemented within that library. The OQL library provides support for data retrieval (via the OQL query language) as well as a query builder for constructing queries in programmatically. There are also class methods for performing all kinds of mutations, including mutations that support the ER view of the database. Furthermore, query and mutation operations all abide by the supplied ER data model.\nSome features of OQL include:\nthe query language is similar to GraphQL in that query results have exactly the structure requested in the query (i.e., you get what you ask for) uses a very simple Entity-Relationship Model description of the database works with the PostgreSQL database system designed to work with existing databases without having to change the database at all","title":"Overview"},{"location":"/installation.html","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"/installation.html#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"/installation.html#typescript-javascript","text":"There is a Node.js module available through the npm registry.\nInstall using the npm install command:\nnpm install @vinctus/oql\nTypeScript declarations are included in the package.","title":"TypeScript/JavaScript"},{"location":"/installation.html#scala-js","text":"There is a Scala.js library available through Github Packages.\nAdd the following lines to your build.sbt:\nexternalResolvers += \"OQL\" at \"https://maven.pkg.github.com/vinctustech/oql\"\n\nlibraryDependencies += \"com.vinctus\" %%% \"-vinctus-oql\" % \"1.0.0-RC.3.23\"\n\nCompile / npmDependencies ++= Seq(\n  \"pg\" -> \"8.5.1\",\n  \"@types/pg\" -> \"7.14.7\"\n)","title":"Scala.js"},{"location":"/usage.html","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"/usage.html#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"/api.html","text":"","title":"API"},{"location":"/api.html#api","text":"","title":"API"},{"location":"/examples.html","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"/examples.html#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"/datatypes.html","text":"","title":"Datatypes"},{"location":"/datatypes.html#datatypes","text":"A datatype, in OQL, is distinct from the notion of an attribute type.

Entity Entities correspond to tables in the database. An entity comprises an identifier matching the name of the corresponding table, which can be given an alias, and a series of attributes. Identifier An identifier can have letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but may not begin with a digit. Alias Aliases are identifiers. Attribute Attributes correspond to columns in a table, if they have a datatype, or a simple entity type (i.e., just the name of an entity). An attribute that begins with an asterisk is the primary key. The name of an attribute can be aliased. An attribute that ends with an exclamation mark can’t be null or excluded when inserting. Type There are several kinds of attribute types: DataType corresponding to a database engine datatype. These attributes correspond to table columns that are not foreign keys. EntityName representing the many-to-one relationship (from the point of view of the current entity). This is the entity relationship type that corresponds to a table column that is a foreign key. [ EntityName ] or [ EntityName ] . AttributeName representing the one-to-many relationship (from the point of view of the current entity). This is the array type that represents all the entities (rows) that are referencing the current entity. [ EntityName ] ( EntityName ) or [ EntityName ] . AttributeName ( EntityName ) representing the many-to-many relationship. The second EntityName in parentheses refers to the junction or link entity (table). < EntityName > or < EntityName > . AttributeName representing the one-to-many relationship (the current entity is the one being referenced by a foreign key). DataType Any one of the basic datatypes that are commonly support by database systems. Any group of datatypes that begin with the same spelling (beyond the first one or two letters) are synonymous (e.g., bool and boolean refer to the same datatype). EntityName An EntityName is an identifier that corresponds either to the identifier given as the entity name if it wasn’t aliased, or to the alias if it was. AttributeName An AttributeName is an identifier that corresponds either to the identifier given as the attribute name if it wasn’t aliased, or to the alias if it was.","title":"Data Modeling Grammar Rules"},{"location":"/syntax.html#query-language","text":"The query language is inspired by GraphQL.

If omitted, result will comprise all datatype attributes only, in the order in which they were defined in the data model. The structure of the result be basically a sequence of expressions each with an implicit or explicit label, namely attributeProject. attributeProject The syntax of an attribute within a project is essentially a possibly optional label, followed by an expression, or an inner query if it is a reference to an array type attribute. label Results are in the form of objects which can are thought of as a list of property/value pairs. Therefore, in order to build a result, the property names have to be known. A label, when it is given becomes the property name of the associated value. If omitted, there are simple obvious rules for inferring it. entityName An entityName is an identifier that names an entity (table) or it’s alias. attributeName An attributeName is an identifier that names a column (attribute) or it’s alias. applyExpression Function application has conventional syntax (e.g., SUM(cost)). Currently, function names pass through transpilation unchecked. attributeExpression An attributeExpression is an identifier that names an attribute, whether it’s a column or not, or it’s alias. qualifiedAttributeExpression This is a reference to an attribute that essentially traverses or dereferences a foreign key. select The select relational operation contains a boolean row selection or filter expression. If omitted, all rows will be retrieved.The row selection condition must be a boolean valued expression. group The group operation contains a series of one or more grouping expressions by which an array result will be grouped. order The order operation contains a series of one or more ordering expressions by which an array result will be ordered.\nrestrict contains one or two integers giving the offset and limit.
